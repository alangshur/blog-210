      <b>About the Blog</b><br>
      <p>
        As Matt expressed so eloquently, this little blog project is the brainchild of Alex (and his 100+ hours of coding during finals week) and the banter of his "completely 
        useless" Stanford peers (although, in recent developments, Ryan has been recruited to the one-man software team). <br><br>
        
        In all seriousness though, this idea quickly evolved from an out-of-nowhere "you dudes want to blog our summer" to a project we're all really amped to begin contributing 
        to and continuously improving. The main developmental premise was to build a <b>completely</b> barebones web app -- no simplifying Javascript frameworks to make "our
        lives easier." Rather, everything was pieced together manually: the code base, the Git, the MVC architecture, the package manager, the web event manager, the Mongo database,
        the Heroku cloud hosting platform, the domain name registration (which wasn't cheap), and much, much more. If you have followed this far into the technical description and
        are actually interested in what's going on under the hood, know that the entire project is open-source; feel free to check out the (gradually improving) Github repository by 
        clicking the icon below.

            <p>
              Alex Langshur might just be the best person you'll ever have the chance to acquaint. Upon meeting Alex for the first time, his now good friend Barack (who you may know as "Obama")
              exclamed in a public address to the nation, "Someone should call the police, because Mr. Langshur just stole my heart." When not lounging with his feline friend, Pickles, you can catch Alex reading textbooks 
              on CS or entrepreneurship, getting annoyed with his friends, or forgetting to eat and hydrate (or just all-around look after himself). <br><br>
        
              If confronted about his attitude, he'll most likely reply with something condescending along the lines of, "I donâ€™t have an attitude problem, you have a perception 
              problem."

                Ryan Kearns is an average dude from an average spiral galaxy. He's been around the sun nineteen times and has no intention of stopping soon (ever?).
                Interests include his work with the Stanford Concert Network, Stanford Student Space Initiative (duh), and pretending like he actually worked on this blog
                when really Alex wrote all the functionality. He lives his life by an assortment of catchphrases, including "high aptitude for shenanigans", "ride the wave",
                "fly it like you stole it", and "it's not rocket surgery!". <br><br>
                
                Prepare for his fire new mixtape coming out never.

            <p>
              Matthew Hall is a young brit perfectly straddling the fine line between class and pure scatty debauchery. He prefers piano to people, women to men (allegedly),
              and molecules to meaningful relationships. You can usually find him at his desk, scrawling directly into the wood in a demented frenzy he refers to as the 
              'chem-hole'. <br><br>
                
              A couple notable quotes about Matt: <br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp'Matt Hall? What a g!' - Mahatma Ghandi <br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp'Who's Matt Hall?' - Alex Langshur <br><br>

            Max Comolli is too busy at the moment with actual adult responsibilities to contribute to the about section of this blog. We'll leave it to him to properly
            introduce himself later on. Meanwhile, a little about him: <br><br>

            &nbsp&nbsp1. The soul of a golden retriever, for better or worse... <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp2. An absolute unit (some of Matt's strange British slang, look it up) <br><br>
            &nbsp&nbsp3. Deserves better friends
