            <h2>About the Blog</h2><br>
            <p>
              As Matt expressed so eloquently, this little blog project is the brainchild of Alex (and his 100+ hours of coding during finals week) and the banter of his "completely 
              useless" Stanford peers (although, in recent developments, Ryan has been recruited to the one-man software team). <br><br>
              
              In all seriousness though, this idea quickly evolved from an out-of-nowhere "you dudes want to blog our summer" to a project we're all really amped to begin contributing 
              to and continuously improving. The main developmental premise was to build a <b>completely</b> barebones web app -- no simplifying Javascript frameworks to "make our
              lives easier." Rather, everything was pieced together manually: the code base, the Git, the MVC architecture, the package manager, the web event manager, the Mongo database,
              the Heroku cloud hosting platform, the domain name registration (which wasn't cheap), and much, much more. If you have followed this far into the technical description and
              are actually interested in what's going on under the hood, know that the entire project is open-source; feel free to check out the (gradually improving) Github repository by 
              clicking the icon below.

                    Alex Langshur might just be the best person you'll ever have the chance to acquaint. Upon meeting Alex for the first time, his now good friend Barack (who you may know as "Obama")
                    exclamed in a public address to the nation, "Someone should call the police, because Mr. Langshur just stole my heart." When not lounging with his feline friend, Pickles, you can catch Alex reading textbooks 
                    on CS or entrepreneurship, getting annoyed with his friends, loving life, or forgetting to hydate. :) <br><br>

                      Ryan Kearns is a minivan fanatic, occasional bluegrass fanboy, rising EDM superstar, and an average dude from an average spiral galaxy. 
                      A Bay Area native, he's lived in a 30-mile radius his whole life, and suffers from perpetual, severe wanderlust. His favorite pastimes include 
                      producing music, daydreaming about Mars, and scheming.

                      Ryan prides himself on organization and dependability, his greatest assets. He is known for sticking things through to the end, and

                    Matthew Hall is a young brit perfectly straddling the fine line between class and pure scatty debauchery. He prefers piano to people, women to men (allegedly),
                    and molecules to meaningful relationships. You can usually find him at his desk, scrawling directly into the wood in a demented frenzy he refers to as the 
                    'chem-hole'. <br><br>
                      
                    A couple notable quotes about Matt: <br><br>
                      &nbsp&nbsp'Matt Hall? What a g!' - Mahatma Ghandi <br><br>
                      &nbsp&nbsp'Who's Matt Hall?' - Alex Langshur <br><br>

                  Max Comolli is too busy at the moment with actual adult responsibilities to contribute to the about section of this blog. We'll leave it to him to properly
                  introduce himself later on. Meanwhile, a little about him: <br><br>
      
                  &nbsp&nbsp1. The soul of a golden retriever, for better or worse... <br><br>
                  &nbsp&nbsp2. An absolute unit (some of Matt's strange British slang, look it up) <br><br>
